EXPLANATION

Here we use the concept of fast and slow pointers
First we traverse 2 pointers at the same time, one that jumps one at a time, and the other that jumps twice at a time.
once we they both meet at a point where both the tortoise and hare are equal, we break the iteration. That's the end of part 1

At the end of the part 1, it could be that both the pointers are at the repeating value, but there are cases where they might not be a the repeating values, 
so directly returning the value of tortoise or hare won't work.
so we move onto part 2.

In part 2 we reset the tortoise to 0th element and keep the hare at the latest position, then we start iterating both the pointers by single jump untill they meet again, 
this time when they meet, it is surely the element that is duplicate, thus we return hare/tortoise.
