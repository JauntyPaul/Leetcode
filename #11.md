EXPLANATION

We take 2 pointer left and right, left is at the left most end of the array and right is at the right most end of the array.

max_area is assigned to 0 initially, formula for area is width x height.

width = right - left, and height is taken the smaller value among the height[ left ] and height[ right ], else water will over flow.

max_area is compared with the prev max_area and the new area which is equal to width * min(height[ left ],height[ right ]), and the higher value is assigned to the max_area.

After this one of the pointer is moved, based on which pointer has lower value, if height[ left ] is smaller, left pointer is incremmented, else if height[ right ] is smaller, right pointer is decremented.

This keeps happening till the pointers overlap.
