We use 3 pointer here, red(0), white(1) and blue(2)

To arrange these numbers, we assign red and white pointer at the position zero and the blue pointer at the end that is at len(nums)-1.

Then we start traversing the white pointer, if it is at a element 0(red color), we swap elements between white and red pointers, and increment their positions.

If the white pointer is at element 1 (white color), we leave it as it is and just increment the white pointer.

Now if the white pointer is at element 2(blue color), we swap the elements at blue and white pointers, soon after that we decrement the blue pointer
