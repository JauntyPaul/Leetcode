EXPLANATION


**Prefix Sum Calculation:**

Traverse through the array while maintaining a running sum (prefix sum) of the elements.


**Hash Map for Frequency Counting:**

Use a hash map (prefix_sum_count) to store the frequency of each prefix sum encountered so far.


**Count Subarrays:**

For each element in the array, calculate the current prefix sum.

Check if prefix_sum - k exists in the hash map. If it does, it means there are subarrays ending at the current index that sum to k.

Increment the count by the frequency of prefix_sum - k.

Update the hash map with the current prefix sum.


**Result:**

The count of subarrays with sum equal to k is returned.



**Detailed Steps:**

Initialize a hash map with {0: 1} to handle cases where subarrays start from the beginning.

Iterate through the array, updating the prefix sum.

For each prefix sum, check if the difference between the current prefix sum and k is in the hash map.

Update the hash map with the current prefix sum frequency.
