EXPLANATION 

Both the pointer left and right are at the index 0 at the initial stage

Then we start moving the right pointer to the right, one by one by iterating thru for loop

If the right pointer is at an none zero element , we swap the elements at left and right pointer, with this the 0's on the left gets moved to right and non-zero elements get swapped to the left.

After the swap, left pointer in incremented.
