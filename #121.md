EXPLANATION

We take the first element as the buy_price and set the profit to 0.

Then we compare whether there is any other cheaper buy_price than the current buy_price, if we find a cheaeper price, we replace the buy_price with the cheaper rate.

Then we compare the difference between the buy_price and the rest of the prices after that element, and the highest difference is assigned to the profit.

Then the proft is returned.
