EXPLANATION

I think it's tough to manage 3 indices at the same time, so my strategy is to fix i.

Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
[-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
  i
We fix i at index 0 at first. Then we have other two indices j and k. j starts from i + 1 and k starts from the last index.

[-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
  i j         k
Basically, we calculate a total of 3 numbers, then if the total is 0, that is one of target triplets.

But there are many cases where the total is not 0. In that case we should move j or k to the next, because we fix i at index 0 at first. All calculations in a loop this time, we must use i number.

My strategy is to sort input array, so that we can decide which index we should move.

That's because if the total is greater than 0, we want small total next time. In that case, we should move k to the next because input array is sorted, we are sure that if k move to left index, we will get small total compared with the current total.

On the other hand, if the total is smaller than 0, we want big total next time. In that case we should move j to the right index to get big total.
