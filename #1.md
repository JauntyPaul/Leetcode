EXPLANATION

For this we use the concept of Hash Map, in python Hash map is executed using Dictionary.

So first we intialize a empty Hash Map named pair_idx, for storing the index and it's value whose compliment is not present in the pair_idx.

That is when we travers thru the array we check the value inside the array and find out the compliment of that value by subtracting it from the target value.

If this compliment value is present in the hash map pair_idx, then we return the values [ i, pair_idx[compliment ] ], that is the location of the iterating element and it's complement's location.

If the compliment value is not present in the hash map, then we add this pair into the hash map pair_idx. 

If both the cases fail, we will return empty array [ ].
