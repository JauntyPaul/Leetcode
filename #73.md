EXPLANATION

We take an empty list k to store the position (i,j) in matrix where the value of the matrix is 0.

Then we traverse in the list k:

Traverse the list k to reassign rows and columns to zero:
Use matrix[i] = [0] * len(matrix[i]) to set the entire row to zeros.
For columns, iterate through each row and set the (j)-th element to zero with for i in range(len(matrix)): matrix[i][j] = 0.
