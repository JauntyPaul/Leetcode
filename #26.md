EXPLANATION

We use 2 pointer i and j, where i keeps jumping forward and j is set at the first position. 

We iterate i from 1 to len(nums), this is how the i keeps jumping

We check whether nums[i-1] is not equal to nuums[i], if they are not equal that means it's a unique number thus we assign that value to nums[j] anad increment the value of j

The value of the j is the number of unique numbers, so we return the value of j.
