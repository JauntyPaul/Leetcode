EXPLANATION

Calculate Total Points: First, calculate the total sum of the first k cards from the start of the array. This will be the initial maximum score.

Sliding Window: Iterate backwards, moving one card from the start to the end for each step:

Subtract the card being removed from the start of the window.
Add the card being added to the end of the window.
Update the maximum score accordingly.
Maintain Maximum Score: Keep track of the highest score achieved during this sliding window operation.
