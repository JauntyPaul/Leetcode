EXPLANATION

Iterate over the array: For each number in nums, treat the absolute value of that number as an index.

Negate the value at the calculated index: If the value at this index is already negative, it means the number corresponding to this index has appeared before, so it is a duplicate.

Collect duplicates: Keep a list of all numbers that you encounter as duplicates.

Return the list of duplicates.
